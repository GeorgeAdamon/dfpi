* Add your first image targets, and wait for them to be processed by Vuforia. They will get a rating. The higher the rating, the more stable the tracking of your targets. Make sure the units correspond to the actual size of your target in the real-world. Make sure your target has lots of small, distinct details. Avoid repetitive textures. Avoid flat colors.
