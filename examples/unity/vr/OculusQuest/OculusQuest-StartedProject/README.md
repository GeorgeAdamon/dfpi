# Oculus Quest Starter Project
 
 ## What is this?
 This is a very simple Unity project that Builds & Runs succesfully on the Oculus Quest (hopefully on the Oculus Quest 2 too)  
 
 ---
 
 It uses the **Universal Render Pipeline** and includes all the **Oculus Integration Package Modules**.
 You probably won't need most of them (like Platform and LipSync, but they are included anyway)
 
 --- 
 
 Tested with Unity 2020.3.9. 
 If your Unity has the Android Module and Android SDK installed, this project should build succesfully on your Quest.
